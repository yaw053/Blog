### Some results' animations:



##### <u>I.  Numerical Model vs SEM-EDS</u>

The SVM-RK numerical model is created by taking in sample's Micro-CT images as input. The following animation shows the a qualitative validation of the constructed SVM-RK numerical model compared with a high-resolution surface image taken by the SEM. In addition, the numerically identified inclusion particles are compared with the particles identified by the EDS elemental mapping.

#### <u>II. 3D elastic z-directional uniaxial tensile simulation with the SVM-RK numerical model</u>

- **<u>The constructed 3D SVM-RK numerical model</u>**: the model is shown in a series of xy-plane slices and is compared with the segmented 2D Micro-CT input images
